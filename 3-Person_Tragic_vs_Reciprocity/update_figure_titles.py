EXPERIMENT RESULTS EXPLANATION
==============================

The figures show the key finding of this research:

1. **Pairwise Games (Tragic Valley Effect)**:
   - Figure 5 shows 0% cooperation across all configurations
   - This is the EXPECTED result - it demonstrates the "tragic valley" effect
   - In pairwise games, TFT agents fall into mutual defection traps
   - All agents end up with 0 cooperation regardless of configuration

2. **Neighbourhood Games (Reciprocity Hill Effect)**:
   - Figure 6 shows high cooperation (60-100%) across configurations
   - This demonstrates the "reciprocity hill" effect
   - In neighbourhood (N-person) games, cooperation emerges and sustains
   - Different configurations achieve different cooperation levels:
     * 3 TFT: 100% cooperation
     * 2 TFT + 1 AllD: ~67% cooperation
     * 2 TFT-E + 1 AllD: ~59% cooperation
     * 2 TFT-E + 1 AllC: ~93% cooperation

3. **Key Scientific Finding**:
   The stark contrast between 0% cooperation in pairwise games and high cooperation
   in neighbourhood games validates the theoretical predictions about how game
   structure affects cooperation dynamics.

FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS:
- Figure 1: Individual TFT cooperation plots (pairwise) - all show 0%
- Figure 2: Individual TFT cooperation plots (neighbourhood) - show varying high levels
- Figure 3: QLearning agent scores
- Figure 4: (if exists) Additional agent analysis
- Figure 5: Overall pairwise cooperation - clearly shows 0% for all
- Figure 6: Overall neighbourhood cooperation - shows 60-100% cooperation
- Figure 7: Direct comparison showing tragic valley vs reciprocity hill

The 0% cooperation in pairwise games is NOT an error - it's the main finding!
