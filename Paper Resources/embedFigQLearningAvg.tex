\caption{Results from the average of 100  500 round tournaments with two
  different sets of agents.  Both sets are two Q-Learning agents with
  one Tit-for-Tat agent with exploration.  They differ by pairwise
  vs. neighbourhood voting, and the average of the Q-Learning agents
  have a line, and the Tit-for-Tat agent has a line.  
  This clearly shows the pairwise agents remaining collaborative while
  the neighbourhood agents descend into the Tragic Valley.}
