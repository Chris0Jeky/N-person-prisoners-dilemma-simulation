\caption{Results from four 50 round tournaments with static agents
  with neighbourhood voting.  3-TFT refers to 3 tit-for-tat agents
  that start cooperating; they continue to cooperate.  2-TFT+D refers
  to two tit-for-tat agents with an agent that always defects; this
  quickly descends to no cooperation.  2-TFT-E+D refers to two
  tit-for-tat agents with 10\% exploration and an always defect agent;
  this system has some cooperations but mostly defects; note that it
  defects more than when there is pairwise voting.  2-TFT-E+C refers
  to two tit-for-tat agents with 10\% exploration and an agent that
  always cooperates; this cooperates about half the time, which is
  less than when there is pairwise voting.}
