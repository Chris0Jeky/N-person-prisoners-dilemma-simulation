\caption{Results from four static 50 round tournaments with
  neighbourhood voting.  3-TFT refers to 3 Tit-for-Tat agents that
  start cooperating; note that they continue to cooperate.  2-TFT+D
  refers to two Tit-for-Tat agents with an agent that always defects;
  this leads to system where the TFT agents collaborate with each
  other and defect against the defecting agent.  2-TFT-E+D refers to
  two Tit-for-Tat agents with 10\% exploration and an always defect
  agent; this leads to a system where the TFT agents have some
  collaboration but mostly defect.  2-TFT-E+C refers to two
  Tit-for-Tat agents with 10\% exploration and an agent that always
  cooperates; the TFT agents mostly collaborate, but there is some
  defection. }
