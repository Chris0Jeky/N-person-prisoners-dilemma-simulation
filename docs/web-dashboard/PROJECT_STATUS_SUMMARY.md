# Project Status Summary - Web Dashboard

## Overview

The N-Person Prisoner's Dilemma Web Dashboard has undergone significant improvements and bug fixes. The application is now stable and functional with enhanced data loading capabilities, better error handling, and improved user experience.

---

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed Critical Issues** ‚úÖ

#### Data Loading
- **Problem**: CSV files with agent-level data wouldn't load
- **Solution**: Created `processAgentLevelData()` method that aggregates agent moves into round statistics
- **Result**: Now supports multiple CSV formats automatically

#### Icon Loading
- **Problem**: "lucide is not defined" errors throughout the app
- **Solution**: Switched from CSS to JavaScript library, created robust initialization system
- **Result**: Icons load reliably without console errors

#### Large File Handling
- **Problem**: Browser crashes with files >5MB
- **Solution**: Implemented Web Worker with progress tracking
- **Result**: Can handle files up to 100MB+ smoothly

### 2. **Added New Features** ‚úÖ

#### Experiment Management
- Clear All Experiments button
- Clear Example Experiments button
- Search and filter functionality
- Bulk export capabilities

#### Enhanced Visualizations
- Chart line toggling for clarity
- Zoom and pan controls
- Consistent color system across all charts
- Loading states and progress indicators

### 3. **Improved Architecture** ‚úÖ

#### Code Organization
```
Before:                          After:
- Monolithic dashboard.js   ‚Üí    - Modular architecture
- Inline data processing    ‚Üí    - Separate data-processor.js
- No error handling        ‚Üí    - Comprehensive error management
- Manual DOM updates       ‚Üí    - Safe update wrappers
```

#### Performance
- Web Worker for background processing
- Efficient CSV parsing
- LocalStorage quota management
- Optimized chart rendering

### Working Features ‚úÖ
1. **Data Import**
   - CSV files (summary and agent-level)
   - JSON files (single and multiple experiments)
   - Drag & drop support
   - Multi-file selection

2. **Visualizations**
   - Cooperation evolution line charts
   - Strategy performance bar charts
   - Network visualization with D3.js
   - Statistical dashboards

3. **Experiment Management**

   - Mobile support
   - Keyboard navigation

### Known Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. No real-time simulation execution (requires backend)
2. Limited to client-side processing
3. No user accounts or persistence beyond localStorage
4. Basic statistical analysis only
