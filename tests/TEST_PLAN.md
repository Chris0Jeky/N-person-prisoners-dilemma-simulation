# NPDL Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the N-Person Prisoner's Dilemma Learning (NPDL) project. It includes information about the current test suite, future test development plans, and best practices for maintaining and expanding the test coverage.

## Testing Philosophy

The NPDL testing strategy follows these principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all components and features of the system.
2. **Isolation**: Test components in isolation where possible to identify issues precisely.
3. **Integration**: Test interactions between components to ensure they work together correctly.
4. **Automation**: Automate tests to ensure consistency and enable continuous integration.
5. **Documentation**: Document test cases to clarify expected behavior and assist future development.

## Current Test Suite

The current test suite includes the following categories:

### Core Component Tests
- `test_agents.py`: Tests for Agent class and various strategies
- `test_environment.py`: Tests for Environment class and network structures
- `test_utils.py`: Tests for utility functions and payoff calculations

### Integration Tests
- `test_integration.py`: Tests for end-to-end simulation workflows

### Visualization Tests
- `test_visualization.py`: Tests for data processing and visualization components

## Test Coverage Map

| Module | Components | Coverage Status | Priority Areas |
|--------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| `npdl.core.agents` | Agent class, Strategy classes | Good | Advanced strategies (LRA-Q, UCB1) |
| `npdl.core.environment` | Environment class, Network creation | Good | Network rewiring, Dynamic environments |
| `npdl.core.utils` | Payoff functions, Matrix creation | Good | Custom payoff functions |
| `npdl.core.logging_utils` | Logging setup, Statistics | Missing | Log formatting, Report generation |
| `npdl.visualization` | Data loading, Processing, Visualization | Partial | Dashboard components, Interactive elements |
| `npdl.interactive` | Game class, Interactive mode | Missing | UI feedback, Player experience |
| `npdl.cli` | Command-line interface | Missing | Command parsing, Error handling |

## Planned Test Development

### High Priority
1. **Dashboard and Visualization**
   - Dashboard component rendering tests
   - Network visualization accuracy
   - Data processing edge cases
   - Response to malformed data

2. **Interactive Mode**
   - Game initialization
   - Player moves and feedback
   - AI opponent behavior
   - Score calculation

3. **Command-line Interface**
   - Parameter parsing
   - Error handling
   - Output formatting

### Medium Priority
1. **Advanced Strategy Tests**
   - Learning Rate Adjusting Q-Learning
   - Wolf-PHC
   - UCB1
   - Strategic behavior in specific scenarios

2. **Enhanced Network Tests**
   - Dynamic network adaptation
   - Network metrics calculation
   - Impact of network structure on cooperation

3. **Logging and Reporting**
   - Log formatting
   - Report generation
   - Statistics calculation

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Tests**
   - Simulation scaling
   - Memory usage
   - Optimization validation

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Parameter validation
   - Configuration file parsing
   - Default values

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Focus on testing individual functions and methods in isolation
- Use mocks for dependencies
- Test both normal operation and edge cases
- Verify both return values and side effects

### Integration Tests
- Test workflows that involve multiple components
- Verify that components work together correctly
- Use realistic test data

### System Tests
- Test the entire system end-to-end
- Verify that all components work together correctly
- Test with realistic scenarios and data

### Test Fixtures and Utilities
- Create reusable test fixtures for common setup
- Develop test utilities for repetitive tasks
- Document fixtures and utilities clearly

## Test Development Process

1. **Identify Gaps**: Review the test coverage map to identify areas that need additional testing
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on high-priority areas first
3. **Implement**: Write tests following the guidelines
4. **Review**: Review tests to ensure they are effective and maintainable
5. **Integrate**: Integrate tests into the continuous integration pipeline
6. **Monitor**: Monitor test results and address failures promptly

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group tests logically by module and functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Organize test files to mirror the structure of the code being tested

### Test Design
- Test one thing per test function
- Make tests independent and idempotent
- Minimize setup and teardown code
- Use fixtures for common setup

### Test Maintenance
- Update tests when code changes
- Remove obsolete tests
- Refactor tests to keep them maintainable
- Document complex test logic

## Continuous Integration

The test suite should be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that:

1. Runs all tests on every commit
2. Reports test coverage
3. Fails the build if tests fail
4. Notifies developers of test failures

## Test-Driven Development

For new features, consider following a test-driven development (TDD) approach:

1. Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior
2. Implement the minimal code needed to pass the test
3. Refactor the code while keeping the test passing

## Conclusion

A comprehensive test suite is essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of the NPDL project. By following this testing plan, we can ensure that the project remains stable and functional as it evolves.
