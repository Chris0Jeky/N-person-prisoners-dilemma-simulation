# Web Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lucide Icon Errors
**Problem**: "lucide is not defined" errors appearing throughout the application
**Solution**: 
- Changed from CSS font-based lucide to JavaScript library
- Created `init.js` with proper dependency checking
- Added `safeCreateIcons()` wrapper function
- Ensured icons are created after DOM updates with `setTimeout`

### 2. CSV File Loading Issues
**Problem**: CSV files with agent-level data (like `experiment_results_rounds.csv`) were not loading correctly
**Solution**:
- Added `processAgentLevelData()` method to handle agent-level CSV data
- Detects CSV format based on presence of `agent_id` column
- Aggregates agent data into round-level statistics
- Properly counts strategies and agents

### 3. Web Worker Errors
**Problem**: "window is not defined" error in Web Worker
**Solution**:
- Created separate `data-processor.js` without DOM dependencies
- Web Worker now uses DataProcessor class instead of DataLoader
- Fixed worker message handling with proper file tracking

### 4. Experiment Management
**Problem**: No way to delete experiments or manage loaded data
**Solution**:
- Added "Clear All" button to remove all experiments
- Added "Clear Examples" button to remove only example experiments
- Added search/filter functionality for experiments
- Added "Export All" button to export all experiments at once

## Files Modified

1. **index.html**
   - Changed lucide from CSS to JavaScript library
   - Added `init.js` for proper initialization

2. **js/dashboard.js**
   - Added `safeCreateIcons()` method
   - Added `clearAllExperiments()` method
   - Added `clearExampleExperiments()` method
   - Added `filterExperiments()` method
   - Fixed all lucide.createIcons() calls to use safe wrapper

3. **js/data-processor.js** (NEW)
   - Created for Web Worker use without DOM dependencies
   - Handles both summary-level and agent-level CSV data
   - Properly aggregates agent moves into round statistics

4. **js/data-loader.js**
   - Added `processAgentLevelData()` method
   - Detects and handles different CSV formats

5. **js/file-worker.js**
   - Now uses DataProcessor instead of DataLoader
   - Fixed message handling with file tracking

6. **js/init.js** (NEW)
   - Ensures lucide is loaded before dashboard initialization
   - Provides global `safeCreateIcons()` function
   - Handles initialization timing issues

## Testing

1. Open `test-fixes.html` to verify:
   - Lucide icons are loading correctly
   - CSV processing handles agent-level data

2. In main dashboard:
   - Upload CSV files with agent-level data
   - Use "Clear All" and "Clear Examples" buttons
   - Search/filter experiments
   - Verify no console errors when navigating

## Usage Notes

### Loading CSV Files
The dashboard now supports two CSV formats:

1. **Summary format** (round-level data):
   ```csv
   round,cooperation_rate,avg_score,num_cooperators,num_defectors
   0,0.5,2.5,15,15
   1,0.6,2.8,18,12
   ```

2. **Agent format** (agent-level data):
   ```csv
   scenario_name,round,agent_id,move,payoff,strategy
   MyScenario,0,0,cooperate,0.5,tit_for_tat
   MyScenario,0,1,defect,1.5,always_defect
   ```

### Managing Experiments
- **Clear All**: Removes all loaded experiments
- **Clear Examples**: Removes only example/demo experiments
- **Search**: Filter experiments by name, strategy, network type, or tags
- **Export All**: Download all experiments as a single JSON file

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Performance**: For very large CSV files (>10MB), processing may still take time
2. **Memory**: Browser localStorage has limits; old experiments are auto-removed if needed
3. **Compatibility**: Tested on modern browsers; older browsers may have issues
